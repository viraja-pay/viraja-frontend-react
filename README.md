# Viraja Pay
This platform enables users to make online transactions as long as they have mobile banking accounts. A great population has mobile phones and this is an innovative way of taking advantage of the growing mobile banking market.

#### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Just clone this repository by typing: https://github.com/viraja-pay/viraja-frontend-react.git
Switch to project directory: cd bucketlist-react
Install project requirements using npm pip. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:
Prerequisites
Nodejs 7 and above
Npm, usually comes with Node (If she's your darl)
We use yarn, so run to https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

To confirm your current setup just type:

node -v
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to 7.*, you might have some issues (we live in a changing world!) but you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

#### Installing
Now, you have nodejs and npm -v has good news about it's version. Lets set up the project environment.(remember we're still in the app directory)

This app was made using create-react-app so, it's easy stuff:

Install Required Node Modules by running:
yarn install
You might need to get our API locally but by default it runs on heroku. If you want to clone it as well, get it here This is enough to get you started.

You can now run the application using:
yarn start
Running the tests
Easy, just: yarn test
